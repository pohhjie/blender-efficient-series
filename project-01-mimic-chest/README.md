# 🧰 Mimic Chest Animation (Blender Practice Project)

This is my first completed Blender project—a 4-second animation of a treasure chest that reveals itself to be a Mimic in disguise. When opened, the chest transforms into a snarling creature, baring its fangs in hostility. Inspired by the **Blender Efficient Creation** course by [@InstructorHandle].

## 💡 Why I Made This

I’ve always wanted to return to 3D modeling, and Blender has been on my bucket list for a while. As a programmer, I’ve previously struggled with tools like Maya and 3ds Max—their interfaces felt overwhelming. But this time, I pushed through.

This Mimic may not be perfect, but I’m proud of finishing it. More importantly, it marks the start of my 3D journey. My long-term dream? Creating an open-world game or an animated short film someday. 😄

## ⚙️ What I Learned

- Basic modeling operations: `extrude`, `inset`, `loop cut`
- Shader and material settings: tweaking `roughness`, `metallic`, `specular`
- Render settings: understanding `Filmic` vs. `Standard` lighting
- Blender UI navigation, modifiers, and animation keyframing

## 📚 Tools & Resources

- Blender 4.x
- [Blender Efficient Creation Course](https://example.com)
- YouTube tutorials (Grant Abbitt, Blender Guru)

---

## 🛠️ Future Plans

- Continue the Blender course to refine skills
- Explore rigging and more complex animations
- Possibly integrate 3D models into Unity or Godot for game prototypes

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m a Computer Science student with a passion for both programming and creative expression. This project marks the blending (pun intended) of both worlds. More to come!
