# 🎨 Blender Efficient Creation Series

Welcome to my Blender learning journey!  
This repository documents the 3D projects I’ve created while following the [Blender Efficient Creation Course](https://seeds.com.tw/en/courses/blender).
Each folder contains a self-contained project, complete with its own assets, `.blend` file and a detailed `README.md`.

## 📌 Project Index

| Project | Description | Key Skills |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| [01 - Mimic Chest](./project-01-mimic-chest) | A treasure chest that transforms into a hostile mimic. My first animated model based on the Efficient Blender Creation course. | Modeling, Shading, Animation |
| ... | ... | ... |

More to come!

## 🛠️ Tools & Workflow
- Blender (v4.x)
- Eevee Renderer
- Blender Plugins (To list down later)

## 🎯 Goals
- Learn Blender through structured tutorials and personal projects
- Document everything clearly as both a **learning log** and **portfolio**
- Experiment with game assets, animations, and VFX
- Eventually build assets for a short animation or game prototype

## 🙋‍♂️ About Me
I’ve always wanted to return to 3D modeling, and Blender has been on my bucket list for a while. As a programmer, I’ve previously struggled with tools like Maya and 3ds Max—their interfaces felt overwhelming. This repository marks the blending (pun intended) of both worlds.
